The eighth stop on our trip to Seoul: a few of the Hangang (Han River in English) Parks for river + light views, night photography, and instant ramyeon and beer by the water (as one does, apparently, when in Seoul). We went to a couple different parks and had a great time, they're very lively and full of couples slurping ramyeon and enjoying being outside by the Han River which bisects Seoul.
