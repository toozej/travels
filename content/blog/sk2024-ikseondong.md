The fiftheenth stop on our trip to Seoul: the Ikseondong neighbourhood to check out more traditional Korean architecture, drink coffee, and shop. This is actually the other neighbourhood we had considered staying instead of Bukchon, but we decided against it since it's pretty close to Myeongdong where we stayed during the first portion of our trip.
