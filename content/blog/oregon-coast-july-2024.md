A quick day trip to the coast to see puffins! Sadly I only saw one from very far away, but Stephanie saw a few with the binoculars. I managed to get a photo, but it's pretty crap. Next time I'll have to rent a huge wildlife-appropriate lens...

We got some good driving in, the R32 is so much fun on the windy coastal back-roads. And I got some clam chowder, which no trip to the coast is complete without!
