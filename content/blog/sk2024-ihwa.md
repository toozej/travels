The nineth stop on our trip to Seoul: the Ihwa Mural Village for street art and hilly views. It's very very steep around here, so put your hiking shoes on! There's some really neat street art here though, much different vibe from other street-art areas that we've been to in other cities, like say Shoreditch in London which are more grungy in subject, with Ihwa having much more wholesome and traditional-feeling murals.

We also found this crazy 270-degree turn single-lane road which we'd seen prior to our trip on a YouTube video, so that was fun to watch cars and scooters navigate, especially considering how steep the road leading up to it is.
