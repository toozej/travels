The fifteenth stop: Grand Teton National Park, WY. Such a stunning set of jagged, shark-tooth mountains! We had a nice drive through the park, and enjoyed checking out the only winery in Wyoming in nearby Jackson. Next time we'll have to do some hikes, but at least we missed the [road collapse](https://apnews.com/article/teton-pass-road-collapse-wyoming-760896e13241d0376b3014ed81ddeda7).
