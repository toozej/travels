The tenth stop on our trip to Seoul: the Namsan Seoul Tower for incredible views across the city, and bonus changing colours of the nearby Namsan park. We were surprised that while the elevator and gondola up to the Tower were packed, that the area in and around the Tower base weren't super over-ran, and that there were a variety of eating and drinking spots as well. We really enjoyed lunch with a great view over the south side of the Han River from The PLACE DINING.
