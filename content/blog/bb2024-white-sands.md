description: "The fifth stop on Boo-batical 2024 - White Sands, New Mexico. We stayed at the Oliver Lee Memorial Campground, which had spectacular sunset views and was nestled up against Dog Canyon, providing much needed breeze from the increasing heat. We visited White Sands National Park near Las Cruces, but alas most of the park was closed due to a downed Air Force plane in the park boundary. We also attempted to camp at San Lorenzo Canyon afterwards, but all the good shady spots were taken. Next time! It made for great photos anyhow."
