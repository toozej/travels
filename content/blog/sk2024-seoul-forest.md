The fourth stop on our trip to Seoul: the Seoul Forest had real London Hyde Park vibes, but half the world away in South Korea. We had a great time walking around the loop, exploring, reading and translating all the signs, and easing into the big-foreign-to-us-city-life with relaxing greenery and changing fall colours. Having big city parks such as the Seoul Forest really help city-dwellers get some quality outdoors time, and equalizes all classes and walks of life.
