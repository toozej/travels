The twelfth stop: Denver, CO. We also pit-stopped in Golden along the way so Stephanie could do the Coors Factory tour, and got some awesome chicken wings nearby. Denver itself was just ok, I think we chose the wrong neighbourhood to stay in (RiNo was meh, Highlands / HiLo was way cooler). We'll have to give it another go, and hopefully take the Winter Park Express train to go skiing!
