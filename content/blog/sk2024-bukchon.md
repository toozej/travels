The fourtheenth stop on our trip to Seoul: the Bukchon Hanok Village to stay in a traditional Korean Hanok house and tour the palaces and history of Seoul. The Hanok we stayed in was beautiful, with traditional wooden sliding doors both inside and out, Korean paper flooring, and a traditional Korean bed (like a futon mattress essentially). The architecture of these old buildings is stunning, and it's incredible they're still here and being lived in and used for a myraid of small business like cafes, cosmetics stores, art galleries and bars after all this time.

The Bukchon Hanok Village is under tourist curfew at night from 1700 to 1000 the next day to keep the neighbourhood quiet for those who live here, and to prevent over-tourism. It seems pretty effective as it was completely quiet walking back to our Hanok after dinners, and also inside our Hanok as well. However I did get sent away from photographing one of the main roads of Hanok houses around 0800 since apparently even those staying in the area cannot be out and about taking photos until 1000 which is pretty disappointing; even our AirBnB receipt wasn't enough to convince the guard to let me stay.
