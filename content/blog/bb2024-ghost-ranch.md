The ninth stop: Ghost Ranch and Plaza Blanca, New Mexico. Seeing the crazy painted hills and other muses for artist Georgia O'Keefe at one of her homes never disappoints! We had a good time hiking around and exploring, but sadly couldn't go to the museums since we had Winston with us. Also Plaza Blanca and the associated mosque were beautiful, if somewhat out of place in the surroundings.
