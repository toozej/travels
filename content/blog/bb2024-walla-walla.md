The seventeenth and final stop: Walla Walla, Washington for some wine tasting on the way home to Portland. L'Ecole winery was really good, as always. Neat to see their "schoolhouse" tasting room, pretty fun spot. We'll be back!


Some statistics from our trip:
- 6020 miles, averaging 19mpg (with a roof-top cargo carrier, not bad!)
- 315 gallons of gas for a total of $1187, averaging $3.79/gal
- 0 speeding or parking tickets
- 0 breakdowns, mechanical issues or really anything except flawless victory from our Lexus GX470
- 10 states traveled through
- 20 nights camped out of 36 days total
- countless bug-bites
- and even more wonderful memories shared between the three of us. What a fantastic, beautiful trip this was!
