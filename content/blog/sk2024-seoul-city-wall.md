The twelth stop on our trip to Seoul: the [Seoul City Wall](https://seoulcitywall.seoul.go.kr/en/index.do) in the Chungsin-Dong neighbourhood just north of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza. The Seoul City Wall, or Hanyangdoseong in Korean, is an ancient wall surrounding the old city built in the late 1300s and spans about 18 miles. I had wanted to hike the entire Wall, but ran out of time on this trip, so we just did a portion of it near the shopping we were already doing around the DDP.
