The fifth stop on our trip to Seoul: the Seongsu neighbourhood nearby the Seoul Forest for some much needed lunch, coffee, and shopping. There's a really nice strip of cute stores and coffee shops along Seoulsup-2 street. We stopped at a coffee shop with a blob on the roof, naturally, and quickly figured out that even savoury items in South Korea are often a bit too sweet for our Western tastebuds; the garlic and cheese bagel we had was full of sweet cream cheese and seemingly also sweetened butter. A bit much, but still a funny little coffee shop.
