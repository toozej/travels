The eleventh stop on our trip to Seoul: the Gangnam neighbourhood for shopping. Famous for the [Gangnam Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_Style) song from 2012, Gangnam is a bustling neighbourhood full of designer shops, high fashion and those who want to be seen. For us not-so-fashionables, we really enjoyed buying cute gifts for friends at the Kakao Friends store, eating pork belly and working on this here website at a cafe with a sweet dog who plopped down next to me.
