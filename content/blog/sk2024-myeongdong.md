The first stop on our fall 2024 trip to Seoul, South Korea: Myeongdong. Super central, easy to get to, vibrant night-life, skyscrapers and winding alleyways-galore. Myeongdong might be a bit of a touristy area, but its really fun to walk around and explore, with restaurants and bars hidden all over the place, and a vibrant nightlife (although sadly the Euljiro drinking alley is slowly being torn down and replaced with more skyscrapers).

It's definitely a great first stop and introduction to Seoul, glad we decided to stay here for the majority of our trip!
