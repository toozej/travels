The third stop on our trip to Seoul: nearby Euljiro for street eats, the excellent [Euljiro brewing](https://www.instagram.com/euljirobrewing/?hl=en), and nightlife. There's so many small bars and restaraunts hidden around every bend here! And it's the closest metro stop to us. 

Speaking of the metro, wow, other cities have a lot to learn about the Seoul metro's efficiency and ease of navigation as a foreigner. The signage and numbered exits which show up in mapping apps are really useful, and if you navigate from point A to B via a metro line mapping apps like Naver will tell you which exits to use, which area of the platform to stand, etc. So helpful!
