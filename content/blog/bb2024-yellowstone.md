The fourteenth stop: Yellowstone National Park, WY. The country's first national park never disappoints! We saw all kinds of cool wildlife, including black and grizzly bears, wolves, badgers, a bald eagle, a crane, and a million bison. Not to mention all the otherworldly geologic features, geysers and pools.
