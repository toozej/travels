The sixth stop on our trip to Seoul: Seoul Station and Seoullo 7017, an overpass turned into a lovely walking park. We had a great time taking photos around here of the trains, huge city buildings, and bonus rose garden that's part of Seoullo 7017. Such a great urbanist project to take over an old highway overpass and turn it into a pedestrian path and garden, especially in such a central area of the city above the main train station. 10/10, we wish more cities would take on projects like this!

I also found it really interesting that the highspeed trains in South Korea appear to be the same trainsets as the French TGVs. I figured they would either be made by Hyundai, or at least purchased from more nearby highspeed train-makers from Japan or China. Similarly, many of the very heavy construction trucks are Scanias and Volvos, which I also would have expected would be made by Hyundai as all the buses (and almost all of the cars around here) are.
