The seventh stop on our trip to Seoul: Namdaemun Market for street eats and gift-shopping. Wow this place is absolutely jam-packed with stalls and street food vendors selling everything from fabrics, dried squid, knock-off designer bags, and Korean corn dogs (which we had to try, can confirm that fried cheese + potato "dogs" are great!). It's a bit of a maze, and very crowded, so maybe for your first visit here don't come with anything specific in mind and just meander around and get lost for a bit, see what you see, and then duck out for a break.
