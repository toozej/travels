The second stop on our trip to Seoul: the Cheonggyecheon canal park and the Dongdaemun Design Plaza to get some steps in and explore a bit. The Cheonggyecheon canal is a great use of urban space, full of runners and walkers and people taking a break from shopping in the nearby Dondaemun markets and shops. The Dongdaemun Design Plaza building is a fantastic piece of architecture, looking like someone crash-landed a space ship right in the middle of Seoul. It's a pretty neat place to take photos, even though we were here during the sunniest part of the day.
