The seventh stop: Santa Fe, New Mexico. Santa Fe is also a repeat destination for us, and while we still enjoyed it we felt like we'd hit pretty much everything here we wanted to do. We were also a bit disappointed with the lack of dog-friendliness and it was hella packed with it being Memorial Day weekend. But we still had a good time!
