The thirteenth stop: Devil's Tower, WY. Featured in several sci-fi movies such as "Close Encounters of a Third Kind", Devil's Tower is a really large strange rock formation in the middle of nowhere. Pretty cool to see though, much more green in real life! The mildly-nearby Keyhole State Park and reservoir is also really nice.
